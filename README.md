# GCxGC Elution Model
The GCxGC Elution Model is an algorithm to estimate GCxGC retention times for a library of individual chemical structures, where "GCxGC" refers to Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. The algorithm is programmed in Matlab.

To obtain the program, [download the latest release as a zip file](https://github.com/GCxGC-Elution-Model/releases/latest). To learn how to use the program, see the [documentation for users](https://github.com/GCxGC-Elution-Model/raw/master/User%20Manual.pdf).
