# GCxGC Elution Model
<p>The GCxGC Elution Model is an algorithm to estimate GCxGC retention times for a library of individual chemical structures, where "GCxGC" refers to Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. The algorithm is programmed in Matlab.</p>
<p>To obtain the program, <a https://github.com/concawe/GCxGC-Elution-Model/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>download the latest release as a zip file</a>. To learn how to use the program, see the <a https://github.com/concawe/GCxGC-Elution-Model/blob/main/User%20Manual.pdf>documentation for users</a>.</p>
